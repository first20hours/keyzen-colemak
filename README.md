Keyzen - Mitch's Colemak Edition
========================
This is a fork of [keyzen-colemak](https://github.com/first20hours/keyzen-colemak) which adds

* optional finger layout picture
* option to turn off sounds
* start over
* start at a certain character (the original had this but it was hard to figure out without the readme)
* make the uppercase letters match the lowercase letters in the order they are added
* remove the background image because it was distracting me

kayzen-colemak itself is a fork of [Keyzen by wwwtyro](https://github.com/wwwtyro/keyzen), modified for learning the [Colemak](http://colemak.com/) keyboard layout.

The key sequence focuses on learning the Colemak home row, then gradually introduces keys in the top and bottom rows. Common punctuation and web navigation characters are added to the mix after learning every lowercase letter. Alpha letters and uncommon punctuation marks are added last.

Keyzen automatically adds new characters to the mix as your errors decrease.
